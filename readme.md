# Musical Instrument (Orchestral) Detection and Classification using Deep Learning
## Overview
##### This project aims to classify audio files into different categories using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on features extracted from the audio files, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, and other relevant audio features.
## Requirments
##### Basic understanding of CNN
##### after installing the project run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download ll the requirments file.
##### this is the datasetlink I got all the dataset and i have selected few of the orchestral instrument from this dataset

## Features
##### Data Processing: The project preprocesses the audio files, extracting features like MFCCs and spectrograms.
##### Model Building: It builds machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or ensemble methods, for audio classification.
##### Model Training: The models are trained on labeled audio data, optimizing for accuracy or other relevant metrics.
##### Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
##### Visualization: The project includes visualization tools to analyze the performance of the models, such as confusion matrices and learning curves.
## Dependencies
##### Python 3.x
##### Libraries: NumPy, librosa, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras
## Usage
##### Data Preparation: Organize the audio files into appropriate directories with corresponding labels.
##### Data Preprocessing: Extract features from the audio files using the provided scripts or functions.
##### Model Training: Train the classification models using the extracted features and labeled data.
##### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
##### Deployment: Deploy the trained models for real-time or batch classification of audio files.
